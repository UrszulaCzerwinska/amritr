## biomarker pipeline (compare Basal vs. Her2)

```{r cars}
library(amritr); data("pathways")
library(mixOmics); data("breast.TCGA")

Y = breast.TCGA$data.train$subtype
X = breast.TCGA$data.train$mrna[which(Y != "LumA")]
Y = droplevels(Y[which(Y != "LumA")])

## run biomarker pipeline for a binary response
#biomarkerPipeline = function(X = X, Y = Y, topranked = 50, validation = "Mfold", M = 5, iter = 1, threads = 1, progressBar = TRUE, pathways = pathways)
```
